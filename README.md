# Psychic-Game
##What is it?
The Psychic-Game is a simple one player letter guessing game that was built by me with JavaScript.

##How does it work?
The player types any  in letter on their keyboard. The player has a certain number of chances to type letter keys in order to guess the mystery letter. If the player guess correctly before their chances runs out, then the player wins the round and a new round begins.  If the player runs out of guesses, the player loses the round and a new round begins. 

##What's the purpose of this project?
I really like the idea of building simple games while getting better at JavaScript at the same. Improving my coding skills is a  very important goal for me;.
